These workflows go through the MADS-annotated dataframe for each assigned agentic workflow and 

1. capture specific agent interactions (for Magentic, it is one orchestrator leading to a sequential series of agents)
2. Toolcalls from those agents using text like web searched, clicked button etc.
3. Plot those results into a NetworkX graph
